As a recap of yesterday:
- needed to upgrade helm a few times due to node crash
- edited to allow cluster metric visibility in grafana

Today:
- Use for studying

Thinking towards the next sprint:
- Leaning towards seperating monitoring and base app into different nodes
- Try getting alerts for cluster metrics
- other ideas based on how much time we think the first 2 will take
