Yesterday/Last Workday:
Implemented Taint/Toleration policies and successfully moved a few metric pods away from the application pods/node.
 - Ones that were not moved are all created by helm charts, so we need to figure out how to move them
    - possibly due to helm referencing other repositories to create them, not directly affected by T&T policies we enacted previously

Today: 
Work on seperating the rest of the pods
